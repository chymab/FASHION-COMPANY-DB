INTRODUCTION

This repository contains SQL dataset of a production company and SQL queries that answers questions about the data.The results of the queries can be found in the analysis Sqlfile.This project focuses on using SQL to analyse customers,order placed and the production report.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

I was  provided with three tables;customer,order and products tables.Where the customer table contains customer details,Orders contains order transactions while the product table contains product details.I was expected to write a query;

- To retrieve some customer details
- Sales amount
- Sales value
- ID number 
- Names with other queries as shown in the pictures included here.

DATA SOURCE

The dataset was gotten from my SQL instructor by name Modinat Ganiyu,who works as an instructor in Dahel Techies.

SKILLS AND CONCEPTS

I used SQL server Management to answer the given queries.

DATA ANALYSIS

- From my analysis,it can be deduced that the female gender had the highest rate of purchase.

- Aready,i filtered and sorted the datas differently inorder to answer the various queries involved.

- I equally customized the output and reported the aggregated data from the database using the GROUP-BY clause.

- I was able to get the list of customers making sure that they didn't appear twice by using DISTINCT COUNT.

- I also counted total products base on their categories.

- I was able to determine the minimum,maximum and average sales made.

- I also recorded the orders placed base on the date they were made including  the quantity of stock in store.
  All these analysis can be seen in the attached file above.

VISUALIZATION

- During the analysis,i noticed that the producer produced more of the female clothings and shoes than the male.

- I was able to record the total stock in store.

- Also,the purchasing power of the female folks are greater than the male counterpart.

RECOMMENDATIONS

From the overall analysis,i recommend that;

- The producers should consider producing more of the unisex wears.This will help to lower significant loss as can be seen in the male counterpart.This will create a situation where the females will purchase the accessories,clothes and shoes without checking the gender it will be suitable for.

- I also recommend that they sign a promotion contract with one of the stars to create awareness about the authenticity and originality of their products.This i believe will help to boost sales.

- The marketing teams should also be made to be more serious by creating percentages that should be theres if they exceed a particular target.
